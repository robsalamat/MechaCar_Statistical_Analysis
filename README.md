# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## I. Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### 1.Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

### 2.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

### 3.Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## II. Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

## III.T-Tests on Suspension Coils

## IV. Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
